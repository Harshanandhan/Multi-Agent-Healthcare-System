## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Roles

The system consists of three specialized agents working in sequence:

1. **Triage Agent** 🚑
   - Initial symptom intake and processing
   - Urgency level assessment (emergency, high, medium, low)
   - Symptom categorization by body system
   - Patient demographic extraction

2. **Knowledge Agent** 📚
   - Medical knowledge retrieval from knowledge base
   - Symptom-to-condition matching with confidence scoring
   - Evidence-based information assembly
   - Context enrichment for response generation

3. **Response Agent** 💬
   - Natural language response generation
   - Medical information formatting for users
   - Personalization based on user context
   - Safety disclaimers and care recommendations

### Communication Flow

```

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-healthcare-system.git
cd multi-agent-healthcare-system
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎯 Usage

### Running the Streamlit Interface

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the API Programmatically

```python
import asyncio
from src.agents.orchestrator import AgentOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()

# Process a query
async def check_symptoms():
    result = await orchestrator.process_user_query(
        query="I have a headache and fever",
        user_data={"age": 30, "gender": "female"}
    )
    print(result['response_text'])

# Run
asyncio.run(check_symptoms())
```

### Example Queries

```
"I have a cough, sore throat, and runny nose that started 2 days ago"

"Severe chest pain and difficulty breathing"

"Headache with nausea and sensitivity to light"

"Stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea for the past day"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Test coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Example Test

```python
import pytest
from src.agents.triage_agent import TriageAgent

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_triage_agent():
    agent = TriageAgent()
    
    result = await agent.execute_task({
        "query": "I have a fever and cough",
        "user_data": {"age": 25}
    })
    
    assert result["status"] == "triaged"
    assert "fever" in result["extracted_symptoms"]
    assert result["urgency_level"] in ["low", "medium", "high", "emergency"]
```

## 📊 System Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics:

- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, success rates
- **Agent Activity**: Messages sent/received, tasks completed
- **Privacy**: PII detected, anonymizations performed
- **Ethics**: Bias detections, fairness scores
- **System Health**: Agent status, error rates

Access metrics through:
- Streamlit sidebar (real-time)
- Orchestrator API (`get_metrics()`)
- Prometheus endpoint (optional)

## 🔒 Privacy & GDPR Compliance

### Data Protection

The system implements multiple privacy safeguards:

1. **PII Detection**: Automatically detects personal information
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Social Security numbers
   - Credit card numbers
   - IP addresses
   - Dates of birth

2. **Anonymization**: Multiple strategies
   - Redaction: `[EMAIL]`, `[PHONE]`
   - Pseudonymization: Consistent fake data
   - Hashing: One-way cryptographic hashing

3. **GDPR Logging**: Article 30 compliance
   - Data access logs
   - Consent tracking
   - Deletion requests
   - Breach notifications

### Example: Anonymizing Data

```python
from src.security.privacy import DataAnonymizer

anonymizer = DataAnonymizer()

# Anonymize text
result = anonymizer.anonymize_text(
    "Contact me at john@example.com or 555-1234"
)
# Returns: "Contact me at [EMAIL] or [PHONE]"

# Anonymize user data
user_data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "age": 30
}
anonymized = anonymizer.anonymize_user_data(user_data)
```

## ⚖️ Fairness & Bias Detection

### Implemented Metrics

1. **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
2. **Equalized Odds**: Equal TPR and FPR across groups
3. **Disparate Impact**: 80% rule compliance
4. **Language Bias**: Detection of biased terms and stereotypes
5. **Representation Bias**: Data distribution fairness

### Example: Checking Fairness

```python
from src.fairness.bias_detection import FairnessMetrics

metrics = FairnessMetrics()

predictions = {
    "group_a": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    "group_b": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
}

result = metrics.calculate_demographic_parity(predictions)
print(f"Fair: {result['fair']}")
print(f"Max Disparity: {result['max_disparity']}")
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking agent communication
2. **Message Queuing**: Efficient message handling
3. **Caching**: Anonymization cache for consistency
4. **State Management**: Redis for distributed deployments
5. **Lazy Loading**: On-demand knowledge base loading

### Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling: Add more agent instances
- Load balancing: Distribute queries across agents
- Caching layer: Redis/Memcached for state
- Message queue: RabbitMQ for reliable delivery
